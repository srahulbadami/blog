The First 3 weeks for GSoC coding period was quite fun. I Learn’t many concepts on Fuse about how to build a basic Android/iOS application .I also learnt how to retrieve data from API’s and use them into your application.

So, At the Beginning of the first week I started to build the app and found it difficult to connect with the api . So, I started designing the basic UI of the application. In the first week I designed the UI with multiple pieces and then connected them together .

Next, My mentors helped me with the API and now I could use the API to retrieve data from the Website and then use it in my app. So, Till now I have made the basic pages ,which shows some data retrieved from the website.

# Plan for the Next Week #

So, In this week I’ve planned to Implement the login/signup page which would then allow the user to report bugs,start a bug hunt and other such functions.
