I got selected for GSoC 2018 for the organization OWASP & the Project is Bughiest , a Bug Logging Tool. Its a platform to Report the software (and hardware) bugs that delay downloads, freeze screens, create payloads that deliver malware to websites and generate other issues .

For the Project my first task is to Port the Python Based web application to an Android/IOS application.

# Plan For the First Week #

To Port the Application I am using [FuseTools](https://www.fusetools.com/ "Fusetools") . Fuse is a set of user experience development tools that unify design, prototyping and implementation of high quality mobile apps. Fuse introduces UX Markup, a declarative-reactive XML-based language for creating native, responsive and smoothly animated interactive Applications.

First of all, The biggest challenge would be to connect the Mobile Application with the website using API ,which would be further used to retrieve data and other information from the server. I would use Django Rest Framework to retrieve the data.

Since, now the Application could retrieve data ,then I would begin the Designs which I had prepared during the community bonding period .

So, this is my plan for the first week of GSoC Coding Period.

The Coding period has already started on 14th May 2018 ,Hope to complete the work ASAP before the end of the week.
