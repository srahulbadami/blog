So, this year when I was checking out this year's GSoC projects I found a project where I could create a platform for people to come and report bugs and company's can organizations Hunts/Bounty Programs for their own respective organizations.

## Tech Stack


**Django**

**Jinja Templates**

**JQuery**

## Phase 1

So, In this phase I would create a basic backbone/structure for my project,i.e a template in which an orgaisation could join and then organise their own hunts, a dashboard for the users/hunters who can join the platform as testers and then hunt for the bugs.

So, basically this phase contains two main components,i.e

**Model Designing**

**Workflow of the Components**

So, during the discussing phase, we create some basic structure for the models, and then In this phase I am going to implemend the same. 

## Major Issues

So, while I was thinking about the project workflow, I found a major issue i.e, how to connect the new system with the earlier/older system. As there was going to be a major Model changes the previous build will surely fail. So the next task will be to create the project in such a way that the older flow does not disrupts.
