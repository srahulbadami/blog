So, today it was the last day for my GSoC project. I wraped up my tasks and then submitted my project for review. 

So, we launched our BLT app in playstore. Altogether, there was a great effort in achieving the application . My mentors supported me in each phase and I learned a loot of new stuffs during this project.

So, during the project I got to learn many new things such as Fuse, Django, things about API and many more. I also got to learn about scheduling tasks, the flow and used it to implement a new way to report bugs on the bugheist platform.

Also, I got to learn about Bug hunts and most importantly why are they necessary in the current tech era. A application can be looked in from many perspective, and can be debugged more effieciently this way.
